# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Memory Bank Maintenance**: Keeping the Memory Bank documentation up-to-date with recent changes
- **Font System Enhancement**: Adding and configuring additional font options for the dashboard
- **UI Enhancement**: Adding a hero section with a globe visualization to the overview page

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank directory and initial documentation files:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Defined core project requirements and goals
  - `productContext.md`: Documented why the project exists and problems it solves
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Outlined system architecture and design patterns
  - `techContext.md`: Detailed technologies used and development setup
  - `activeContext.md`: This file - tracking current focus and changes
  - `progress.md`: Documenting project status and next steps
- **Font System Enhancement**:
  - Added Feature Flat font family files to the project
  - Added font files: FeatureFlatCond-Regular, FeatureFlatCond-Medium, FeatureFlatHeadline, and FeatureFlatText-Bold
  - Prepared for potential integration with the existing font system
  - Added Simplon BP font family to the project
  - Integrated Simplon BP fonts (regular and medium weights) into the Next.js font system
  - Updated Tailwind configuration to make Simplon BP available via the `font-simplonbp` utility class
- **UI Enhancement**:
  - Added a hero section with a globe visualization to the overview page
  - Installed the `cobe` library for the interactive globe component
  - Created a new component at `src/components/ui/overview/HeroGlobe.tsx`
  - Integrated the hero section above the "Current billing cycle" section

## Next Steps
- Explore the dashboard components in more detail
- Understand the data flow and state management
- Document specific UI patterns and component usage
- Identify areas for potential enhancement or customization
- Consider creating additional documentation for complex features
- Evaluate how to integrate Feature Flat fonts into the application
- Consider creating a typography system that leverages all available fonts (Colfax, Barlow, Simplon BP)
- Document best practices for font usage across different UI components
- Test the Simplon BP font implementation across different components

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Documentation Structure**: Organized Memory Bank files according to the specified hierarchy
- **Content Detail Level**: Balanced between high-level overview and specific implementation details
- **Project Understanding**: Based on available files and structure, without running the application yet
- **Font System Strategy**: Added Feature Flat and Simplon BP fonts to complement existing Colfax and Barlow fonts
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Considering how to structure typography with multiple font families for different UI elements

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **File Organization**: Following Next.js App Router conventions
- **Component Structure**: Reusable components with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation Style**: Markdown with clear headings and bullet points for readability
- **Memory Bank Updates**: Will require regular updates as project understanding deepens
- **Font Management**: Using Next.js local font optimization for performance
- **Typography System**: Structured approach with specific font families for different UI elements

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project uses a comprehensive set of modern React libraries and patterns
- Strong focus on component reusability and composition
- Clear separation between UI components and data management
- Emphasis on accessibility through Radix UI components
- Tailwind CSS used consistently for styling
- Data visualization is a key feature with Recharts integration
- Table functionality enhanced with TanStack Table
- Typography system leverages Next.js font optimization for performance
- Multiple font families (Colfax, Barlow, Simplon BP) provide design flexibility for different UI contexts
- Font configuration in Tailwind enables consistent typography across components

## Current Questions
- How is authentication handled in the application?
- What is the intended deployment strategy?
- Are there specific customization points designed into the template?
- How is theming implemented beyond the basic Tailwind configuration?
- What testing strategies are recommended for the template?
- What is the intended use case for the Feature Flat font family in the dashboard?
- How should the typography system be structured to incorporate multiple font families effectively?

## Recent Insights
- The template provides a comprehensive starting point for dashboard applications
- Component organization follows logical grouping by function and complexity
- Next.js App Router provides a clean way to organize pages and layouts
- The project balances between providing structure and allowing customization
- Typography plays a crucial role in the dashboard's visual identity
- The font system is designed to be flexible with multiple font families for different purposes
- Next.js font optimization provides performance benefits through local font loading
