# Progress

## Current Status
- **Initial Setup**: Memory Bank documentation structure has been established
- **Project Understanding**: Basic understanding of the project structure and purpose has been documented
- **Documentation**: Core Memory Bank files have been created with initial content
- **Font System**: Feature Flat font family has been added to the project

## What Works
- **Project Structure**: The Next.js application structure is in place with App Router organization
- **Component Library**: Comprehensive set of UI components available in `src/components/`
- **Page Routes**: Basic routes established for overview, details, and settings sections
- **Data Visualization**: Chart components implemented with Recharts
- **Tables**: Advanced table functionality with TanStack Table
- **Navigation**: Sidebar and mobile navigation components
- **Settings Sections**: General, billing, and users settings pages

## What's Left to Build
- **Custom Features**: Any specific features beyond the template functionality
- **Data Integration**: Connection to real data sources instead of sample data
- **Authentication**: User authentication and authorization system
- **API Routes**: Backend API routes for data operations
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for components and pages
- **Deployment**: Production deployment configuration
- **Documentation**: End-user documentation for the dashboard

## Known Issues
- No specific issues identified yet, as this is an initial documentation phase

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Documentation Approach
- **Initial Decision**: Create Memory Bank structure according to specified hierarchy
- **Current Status**: Basic documentation created based on project file exploration
- **Future Direction**: Enhance documentation as project understanding deepens

### Project Understanding
- **Initial State**: Limited understanding based on file structure and README
- **Current State**: Basic understanding of architecture, components, and technologies
- **Next Steps**: Deeper exploration of component implementations and data flow

### Font System
- **Initial State**: Using Colfax for primary sans-serif and Barlow for headings
- **Current State**: Added Feature Flat font family (Condensed Regular, Condensed Medium, Headline, Text Bold)
- **Next Steps**: Potentially integrate Feature Flat fonts into the application's typography system

## Milestones

### Completed

- ‚è≥ Feature enhancement planning

## Implementation Notes

### Documentation Structure
The Memory Bank follows the specified structure with six core files:
1. `projectbrief.md`: Foundation document defining core requirements
2. `productContext.md`: Why the project exists and problems it solves
3. `systemPatterns.md`: System architecture and design patterns
4. `techContext.md`: Technologies used and development setup
5. `activeContext.md`: Current work focus and recent changes
6. `progress.md`: This file - tracking project status and next steps

### Next Steps for Documentation
- Run the application locally to better understand its functionality
- Document specific component usage patterns
- Create visual documentation of the UI structure
- Document data flow and state management patterns
- Identify customization points and document them

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of structured documentation for project understanding
- The value of exploring file structure to understand project organization
- The benefit of documenting technologies and patterns early in the process
- The significance of typography in creating a consistent and professional UI
- The flexibility of Next.js font system for managing multiple font families

## Future Considerations
- How to extend the template for specific use cases
- Best practices for data integration
- Performance optimization strategies
- Accessibility improvements
- Testing strategies for the dashboard components
